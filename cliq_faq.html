<h1>PROJECT CLIQ Information for potential study participants</h1>
  <h2>
  What is Project CLIQ? </h2>
  <p>Project CLIQ is a clinical research study that is being conducted by researchers from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital. We are enrolling about 2,000 patients who may be smokers and who have recently seen their primary care physician.</p>
  <p>
  CLIQ stands for “Community LInk to Quit.” </p>
  <h2>What would I need to do if I joined the study?</h2>
  <p>Eligible patients who join the study are assigned to one of two groups. Neither you, your doctor, or anyone on the study team decides which group you will be in--a computer does something like flipping a coin to assign you.</p>

  <p><strong>Group 1  People in this group receive:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>A package of resources that may help you quit smoking</li>
    <li>Two automated phone calls, one at the beginning of the study and another 9 months later. These calls take 5-10 minutes to complete. An automated voice will ask you about your smoking and whether you have tried to quit. The last call also will ask for your feedback on what it was like to be part of the study.</li>
    <li>Calls with a Tobacco Treatment Coach: If you would like, you can talk to a tobacco treatment coach. This is someone who (xxxxx explain about credentials, training). If you agree to speak with a coach, you can get a six-week supply of free nicotine patches (as long as there are no medical reasons why you cannot use the patch). You also can ask the coach about programs in your community that may help you to quit smoking or stay quit.</li>
    <li>Additional automated calls: Participants who choose not to speak with a tobacco treatment coach on the initial call will receive two additional automated calls. During these calls you will again be asked whether you would like to speak with a tobacco treatment coach, in case you change your mind. </li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>Group 2   People in this group receive:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Two automated phone calls, one at the beginning of the study and another 9 months later. These calls take about 5-10 minutes to complete. An automated voice will ask you about your smoking and whether you have tried to quit. The last call will also ask for your feedback on what it was like to be part of the study.</li>
    <li>Referral to the Massachusetts Phone Quitline: You will receive information about tobacco treatment coaching that is available from Massachusetts Quitworks, a free telephone helpline for people who smoke.</li>
    <li>People will be encouraged to speak with their primary care doctor about resources that can help quit smoking. Patients who do not receive nicotine replacement patches as part of the study can receive them, and other products to help them quit, by asking their doctors.  Many products to help people quit smoking, like the patch, are available at local pharmacies without a prescription.  </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Will being in the study help me? </h2>
  <p>If you participate in Project CLIQ, you may quit smoking or stay quit for a longer period of time. Quitting smoking can add years to your life and improve your health and well-being. Quitting is difficult, but nearly 3 million Americans a year quit smoking.</p>
  
  <h2>Could being in the study harm me? </h2>
  <p>People in the study may feel uncomfortable talking about smoking or answering questions about smoking on the phone. </p>
  
  <p>Participants in Project CLIQ who complete the calls may have the information they provide about smoking entered into their medical record. That information may help their doctors make decisions about their medical care. The tobacco treatment coach also will have access to this information in order help participants quit smoking.  </p>
  <p>
  Although we carefully protect your information, there is a small chance of potential loss of confidentiality of your medical information. </p>
  <p>
  <p>People who use the nicotine patch may have side effects like mild itching or tingling of the skin under the patch, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, diarrhea, nervousness, restlessness, headache, vivid dreams, other sleep disturbances, and irritability.  For most people the side effects are mild.  A small group of people may develop skin irritation around the patch, irregular heartbeats or palpitations, or chest pain or tightening.  These side effects are rare but if you develop one you should contact us and your primary care doctor right away. The patch is used safely by millions of people every year.</p>
  
  <h2>What will I get in return for participating in Project CLIQ?</h2>
  <p>All participants in Project CLIQ who complete the final automated call will be entered into a monthly raffle for two $100 Target gift cards. Approximately 1 out of every 40 people who complete the final call will win a gift card.</p>
  
  <h2>What should I do if I NEVER want to be called by Project CLIQ?</h2>
  <p>If you do not want to receive any calls from Project CLIQ, you should dial 1-866-640-0387 and leave your name.  We check this voice mailbox each day. As soon as we receive your name, we will remove you from our call list.</p>
